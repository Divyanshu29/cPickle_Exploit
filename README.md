While doing Amateriia challenges on smash the stack i came accross for the first time cPickel concept.
cPickle is a python module for serializing and de-serializing data. On https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html there comes a warning saying that "Never pass untrusted data via cPickle. Security risk invovled" which clearly tells that we can execute code on remote system on a server using cPickle.
